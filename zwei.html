									<h1>Zwei</h1>
									<p>Zwei was my first creation. It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=29E6A165847C4F16BF831A6D5D96545A">Roguelike</a><br />
									videogame developed with Unreal Engine 4 in Blueprints<br/>
									It was my Final Degree Project and my first opportunity to make my own videogame.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Imagen1.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Zwei is a knight who has to escape from the ruins and, for this purpose, he is going to fight against tons of enemy waves. Fortunately, he will receive help
								from his deceased relatives such as improvements in his damage or his attack speed, even he can rise his health amount. But something he doesn't know is that enemies can adapt to his skills and become more and more powerful.
								He can choose between two weapons: a Bow and a Greatsword. This allows the player to choose two styles of play completely different.</p>

								</video>
								<p><br/>In the first video footage he is using his Greatsword, which needs to be close to the enemies to inflict its damage. It's made for players who like to do a lot of damage at the expense of their safety.</p>
								<video class='video' controls>
									<source src="videos/Zwei_Bow.mp4" type="video/mp4">	
								</video>
								<p><br/>In the second video footage he is using his Bow, the classic long-range weapon. It's made for players who like to do less damage, but they can inflict it from more secure positions.</p>
